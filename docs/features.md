### Look and Feel controls for theme, bar position, and wallpaper

Here you can switch between predefined themes.  The `themeUpdateScript` will be called
when switching themes.  The theme name you defined will be the first argument passed to the script.

You can switch the bar position here.

You can choose your wallpaper.  The wallpapers listed here are the ones found in the
directory defined in the theme's config.  JPG and PNGs in that directory will show up.
When selecting a wallpaper, the `wallpaperUpdateScript` will be called with the wallpaper
path as the argument.  That update script is in charge of setting the wallpaper with whatever
wallpaper program you use.

OkPanel will remember which wallpaper you last selected for each configured theme.  When
switching themes, the `wallpaperUpdateScript` will be called as well.

## Clipboard Manager

Click the Clipboard widget in the bar to show the clipboard manager.  The manager is backed by `cliphist`.  
Cliphist will only run if the clipboard manager widget is added to the bar.  Sensitive information like
passwords, api keys, private keys, etc should be filtered out.  Check the [script](https://github.com/JohnOberhauser/OkPanel/blob/main/ags/shellScripts/cliphistStore.sh)
or disable the widget if you have concerns.
