## Using without installation

You can run the project without installing if you wish.  This is good for dev work.  Just use the bins in the 
`bin` directory.  Note that if you have okpanel installed and try to run the bin from the checked out project,
the installed version will run.  So make sure you uninstall first.

```
git checkout git@github.com:JohnOberhauser/OkPanel.git
cd OkPanel/bin
./okpanel run
```
